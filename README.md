### Description

Using my knowlegde from Go I chose to take a school project I had to do in Java and convert it to Go. Since Go does not use OOP, I had to get creative with how I wanted to create "Classes" like used in Java. This project was fun and hepled me to expand my knowledge of Go. 

## Tech Stack:
- **Language**: Golang

### Get Up and Running
Download the code and use the command `go run main.go`. This will run the code in the main file.
